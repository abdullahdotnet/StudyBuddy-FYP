      "An algorithm is a set of steps to solve a problem. It is written in a natural language, so it is easily understandable by humans. For example, to solve the problem of preparing tea, we can follow the following steps.\n",

      "c) Pour water in it.\n",
      "d) Put the kettle on fire.\n",

      "g) Remove the kettle from fire. h) End.\n",
      "The above set of steps can be called an algorithm for tea preparation.\n",
      "We can also solve certain problems with the help of a computer. For that purpose, we first formulate an algorithm for the problem and then translate that algorithm into a set of instructions for the computer.

We encrypt each letter of the plaintext by finding that letter in column labels of the Vigenere table (Table 4-1) and in that column, we find a letter that is in front of the row label for the respective letter of the key. We continue this process until all the text is finished.\n",
      "Example: Let's assume that we want to encrypt “PAKISTAN” with the help of substitution key “ZINDABAD\". We find ‘P’ (first letter of plaintext) in column labels and ‘Z’ (first letter of substitution key) in row labels. We can observe that the row and the column meet at letter ‘O' as marked with yellow colour in Table 4-1. So, the letter ‘P’ is converted to ‘O’. Similarly, we find the letter ‘A’ in column labels which is the first column (marked with green colour) in Table 4- 1. and we find the letter ‘I’ in the row labels. Row and the column meet at the letter ‘T’. So, ‘A’ is replaced with 'T’.\n",
      "In this way the word “PAKISTAN” is converted to cypher text “OIXLSUAQ\" as shown in Table 4-2.\n",
      "Column Label\n",
      "Row Label Common Letter\n",
      "Table 4-2\n",
      "Important Note: If the key has less number of letters, then we repeat the letters of that key from beginning. For example, to encrypt the text “PAKISTAN” having 8 letters with the key “BEAUTY” having 6 letters, we repeat the letters of the key to make them equal in length to the given plaintext. So, the key becomes “BEAUTYBE” having same number of letters and this key is called intertm ciphertext.\n",
